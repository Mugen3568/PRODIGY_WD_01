Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. Use HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over. This is a website which is built with the "Dimension" HTML5 template. It includes multiple pages (index, task, about, contact) with a responsive design featuring modal-style content sections. The site uses jQuery for interactivity, Sass for styling, and follows modern web development practices with separate CSS/JS assets.
